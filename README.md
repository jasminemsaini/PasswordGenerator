# Password Generator
A simple program that generates a random password while satisfying the common password requirements (i.e., having at least 8 characters, one uppercase and one lowercase letter, and one special character). The user inputs the desired length of the password. 

Run the following in the terminal after installing python:
```
python generator.py
```
Some Examples:
```
Enter the desired length of the password: 13
Your password is: +>72A3d9M'lIt
```
```
Enter the desired length of the password: 0
The password must have at least 8 characters.
Please enter again!
```
